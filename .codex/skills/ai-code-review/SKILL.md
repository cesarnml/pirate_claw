description: Detect and triage AI-generated pull request review comments for the delivery orchestrator flow. Use when `poll-review` finds AI review feedback or when you need to inspect recent AI review comments on the current PR.

# AI Code Review

This is a repo-local delivery skill. It is intended to travel with the orchestrator workflow as that workflow becomes template-ready.

## Boundary

The orchestrator owns:

- polling cadence and stop conditions
- delivery state transitions
- artifact persistence under `.codex/delivery/.../reviews/`
- auto-recording `clean` when no AI review is detected by the final check

This skill owns:

- fetching review data with `gh`
- deciding whether fetched comments count as AI review
- normalizing detected comments into a review artifact
- triage judgment after comments are detected

The only contract between them is the helper script output:

- `detected: true|false`
- `artifact: "<normalized text for triage>"`

Use this skill when the orchestrator has saved an AI review artifact or when you need to inspect recent AI review comments on a PR in this repo.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the PR number with `gh pr view` if the user did not provide one.
2. Fetch review data with the repo-local helper script:
   - `.codex/skills/ai-code-review/scripts/fetch_ai_pr_comments.sh <pr-number>`
3. Apply the detection policy in the helper script:
   - comments from bot or vendor identities that correspond to AI review
   - comments whose wording explicitly identifies them as AI-generated code review
   - ordinary human drive-by comments do not count as AI review
4. Return the helper-script contract to the orchestrator when this is being used inside `poll-review`:
   - `detected=false` means keep polling or auto-clean at the end
   - `detected=true` means save the artifact and hand off to judgment
5. Triage each detected AI review comment before recommending any action.
   Classify it as actionable, stale, wrong, over-scoped, or out of scope.
6. Treat AI review comments as advisory, not authoritative.
   They are never gospel and should not be implemented blindly.
7. Apply the repo's `ai-cr` policy explicitly.
   Push back on stale, over-scoped, unnecessary, or policy-conflicting suggestions.
8. If the user explicitly approves your triage and asks you to patch, make the patch immediately.
9. After applying an approved patch:
   - run the smallest relevant verification
   - commit the patch changes in the current repo
   - push the current branch so the PR updates automatically

## Output expectations

- Start with whether AI review comments were found.
- Filter out generic summary noise by default and focus on unresolved review items.
- State which comments are actionable and which should be rejected.
- Group by unresolved issue, not by raw API payload.
- Include file and line when available.
- Call out stale or already-addressed comments explicitly instead of blindly implementing them.
- Only stop for operator input when the right action is genuinely ambiguous.
