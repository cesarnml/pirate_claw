# Repo Rules

- If the user says `triage`, use `.agents/skills/ai-code-review/SKILL.md`.
- For phase work, first read `docs/00-overview/start-here.md` and `docs/03-engineering/delivery-orchestrator.md`, then surface the orchestrator path before coding.
- Use `.agents/skills/son-of-anton-ethos/SKILL.md` automatically when a user asks to execute, begin, start, deliver, implement, continue, resume, run, drive, carry, or work on an approved multi-ticket phase or epic, or uses equivalent wording that clearly means end-to-end orchestrated execution. Also use it when the user explicitly mentions `son of anton`, `son-of-anton`, `son of anton ethos`, or `son-of-anton ethos`. **Standalone (non-ticketed) PRs:** use the same skill when the work is a standalone PR (no ticket stack for this change)—including running the orchestrator `ai-review` path, verify-first discipline, and post-verify self-audit before external agent review. See **Standalone (non-ticketed) PRs** in that skill. Do not wait for the skill to be named explicitly. That skill is authoritative for execution mechanics, continuation bias, stop conditions, polling behavior, and review outcome recording — do not rely on this file for those.
- For new product feature-set expansion, phase shaping, or epic decomposition work, run an explicit planning pass and use `grill-me` before accepting a plan or ticket breakdown. In this repo, son-of-anton treats developer engagement in ideation, decomposition approval, and final delivered-slice approval as required control points rather than optional ceremony. Plan Mode is optional workflow support, not a repo policy requirement.
- The delivery orchestrator reads `orchestrator.config.json` at the repo root for default branch, plan root, runtime internals, and package-manager-aware bootstrap defaults. See `docs/03-engineering/delivery-orchestrator.md` for field details and scope.
- Prefer `bun run deliver --plan ...` over ad hoc implementation. In this repo, `bun run deliver` remains the supported operator entrypoint even though the orchestrator internals are more configurable.
- For orchestrated ticket work, the handoff under `.agents/delivery/<plan-key>/handoffs/` is required input alongside the plan and ticket docs.
- New product phase/epic implementation starts only after the developer has reviewed and approved the delivery decomposition into thin, reviewable tickets.
- New product-scope expansion requires a planning pass and developer-approved ticket decomposition before implementation begins. When those are missing, surface the gap, point to the required planning docs, and wait. Docs-only, cleanup-only, and tooling-only changes that do not expand the product surface skip this requirement.
- Smaller bounded product changes can proceed as standalone PRs without a new phase/epic. Use the orchestrator's standalone `ai-review` path for those rather than the ticketed stacked flow. Follow `.agents/skills/son-of-anton-ethos/SKILL.md` (**Standalone (non-ticketed) PRs**).
- Final merge or advance of delivered stacked PR slices remains a developer approval step.
- After developer approval of a completed stacked phase, close it with `bun run closeout-stack --plan <plan-path>` rather than manual merge/cherry-pick steps.
- `pr`: if a delivery ticket is clear from branch/docs/diff, use a human-readable Conventional-Commit-style subject plus the active ticket suffix, for example `[P3.02]`. Otherwise omit the suffix.
- Any PR creation or PR-body drafting should follow the same `pr` conventions even when the user did not literally type `pr`.

## Pre-Commit

Before an AI agent creates a commit:

- if it changed files covered by Prettier, run `bun run format` or `bun run format:check` and fix any failures before committing; if it changed `web/`, also run `bun run format:check:web` or `bun run format:web` (root `format` / `format:check` still exclude `web/` via `.prettierignore.root`); or run `bun run verify` to cover root checks plus `verify:web`
- if it changed docs, Markdown, config examples, PR text, or other user-facing copy, run `bun run spellcheck` and fix any failures before committing

## Ticket Completion Checklist

Before calling a delivery ticket complete:

- update the delivery ticket doc itself with a `## Rationale` section when the ticket introduces or changes behavior; do not treat PR bodies, review notes, or chat as the source of truth for rationale
- append later non-redundant review, validation, or implementation findings to that same `## Rationale` section instead of creating a parallel rationale artifact
- check whether `README.md` needs an update when user-visible behavior, command surface, or project status changed
- check whether `docs/00-overview/start-here.md` needs an update when a phase or ticket changes delivered scope, current commands, delivered status, or deferrals
- check whether `docs/00-overview/roadmap.md` needs an update when a phase or ticket changes delivered scope, delivered status, active phase state, working notes, or deferrals
- check whether `docs/README.md` needs an update when a new phase plan, delivery doc, or durable doc path was added
- verify the relevant tests or checks for the completed work

## On Phase or Epic Completion

- Before marking the phase complete: write `notes/public/<plan-path>-retrospective.md` (what went well, pain points, improvements) (e.g. `phase-12-retrospective.md` vs `epic-03-retrospective.md`).
