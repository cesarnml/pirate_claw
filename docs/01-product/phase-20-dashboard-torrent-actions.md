# Phase 20: Dashboard Torrent Actions

**Delivery status:** Not started — product definition only; no `docs/02-delivery/phase-20/` implementation plan until tickets are approved.

## TL;DR

**Goal:** Make the dashboard a functional proxy for the Transmission client. Add torrent lifecycle actions via a right-click context menu on TorrentManagerCard rows, wire up the Queue button in FeedEventLogCard, and clean up the data model by replacing the redundant `CandidateLifecycleStatus` with a derived state pattern and a new `pirateClawDisposition` field.

**Ships:** Pause, resume, remove, remove+delete torrent actions; missing-torrent disposition resolution; manual requeue of failed/skipped candidates; data model clean break.

**Defers:** Router extraction (future Hono migration); multi-torrent bulk actions; audit log.

## Data Model Clean Break

### Problem

`CandidateLifecycleStatus` (`queued | downloading | completed | missing_from_transmission`) duplicates knowledge already present in `transmissionStatusCode`. The reconciler writes to it on every cycle, creating two competing sources of truth that drift whenever the user acts directly on the Transmission web UI.

### Solution

**Drop `CandidateLifecycleStatus` entirely.** Replace all reads with a pure `torrentDisplayState()` function that derives display state at read time from live Transmission data.

**Add one new field:** `pirateClawDisposition?: 'removed' | 'deleted'` — the only two states Transmission cannot represent itself (user intentionally removed or wiped via Pirate Claw). Terminal once set; reconciler skips candidates where it is set.

### Startup Migration

Two idempotent SQL statements run at daemon startup:

```sql
ALTER TABLE candidates DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS lifecycle_status;
ALTER TABLE candidates ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS pirate_claw_disposition TEXT;
```

No manual operator action required. Existing candidates carry forward with `pirate_claw_disposition = NULL`, which is correct — they continue to derive state from `transmissionStatusCode`.

### Derived State Function

Replaces all `lifecycleStatus` reads across backend and frontend:

```ts
type TorrentDisplayState =
  | 'queued'
  | 'paused'
  | 'downloading'
  | 'completed'
  | 'missing'
  | 'removed'
  | 'deleted';

function torrentDisplayState(
  candidate: CandidateStateRecord,
  liveHashes: Set<string>,
): TorrentDisplayState {
  if (candidate.pirateClawDisposition) return candidate.pirateClawDisposition;
  if (!candidate.transmissionTorrentHash) return 'queued';
  if (!liveHashes.has(candidate.transmissionTorrentHash)) return 'missing';
  if (candidate.transmissionPercentDone === 1) return 'completed';
  if (candidate.transmissionStatusCode === 0) return 'paused';
  return 'downloading';
}
```

### Reconciler Guard

Reconciler filters candidates with `WHERE pirate_claw_disposition IS NULL` before polling Transmission. Terminal candidates are never polled again.

## Torrent Manager Card — Context Menu Actions

Right-click anywhere on a torrent row opens a context menu. Available actions are derived from `torrentDisplayState`:

| Display State         | Available Actions                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `downloading`         | Pause, Remove, Remove + Delete Data             |
| `paused`              | Resume, Remove, Remove + Delete Data            |
| `missing`             | Mark Removed, Mark Deleted                      |
| `completed`           | Remove (no disposition write — stays completed) |
| `removed` / `deleted` | None (terminal, rendered differently)           |

In-flight: menu disabled while request is in flight. On failure: inline error displayed in context menu.

### State Transition Rules

- **Pause** → valid only from `downloading`. Sets Transmission torrent to stopped. No DB write (state derived from `transmissionStatusCode === 0` on next poll).
- **Resume** → valid only from `paused`. Sets Transmission torrent to started. No DB write.
- **Remove** → valid from `downloading` or `paused`. Removes torrent from Transmission (data preserved on disk). Writes `pirateClawDisposition = 'removed'`. If candidate was `completed` at time of removal, no disposition write (stays completed).
- **Remove + Delete Data** → valid from `downloading`, `paused`, or `completed`. Removes torrent and deletes local data via Transmission RPC `delete-local-data: true`. Writes `pirateClawDisposition = 'deleted'`.
- **Mark Removed / Mark Deleted** → valid only from `missing`. No Transmission RPC call (torrent is already gone). Writes `pirateClawDisposition` to resolve limbo.

## New API Endpoints

All new endpoints are flat `if (path === ... && request.method === 'POST')` blocks in `createApiFetch`. Request body is JSON. All transmission action endpoints accept `{ hash: string }`.

| Endpoint                                           | Transmission RPC                             | DB Write                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /api/transmission/torrent/pause`             | `torrent-stop`                               | none                                                          |
| `POST /api/transmission/torrent/resume`            | `torrent-start`                              | none                                                          |
| `POST /api/transmission/torrent/remove`            | `torrent-remove`                             | `pirateClawDisposition = 'removed'` (if not completed)        |
| `POST /api/transmission/torrent/remove-and-delete` | `torrent-remove` + `delete-local-data: true` | `pirateClawDisposition = 'deleted'`                           |
| `POST /api/transmission/torrent/dispose`           | none                                         | `pirateClawDisposition = body.disposition` (resolves missing) |
| `POST /api/candidates/:id/requeue`                 | none (calls `downloader.submit` directly)    | writes `transmissionTorrentId/Hash` on success                |

### New Transmission Service Functions (in `src/transmission.ts`)

Following the existing session-negotiation pattern (409 retry):

- `pauseTorrent(config, hash)` → `torrent-stop`
- `resumeTorrent(config, hash)` → `torrent-start`
- `removeTorrent(config, hash, deleteLocalData: boolean)` → `torrent-remove`

---

## FeedEventLogCard — Queue Button

The existing stub Queue button is wired to `POST /api/candidates/:id/requeue`.

- Endpoint calls `downloader.submit(candidate.downloadUrl)` immediately (Option A: synchronous, not deferred to next daemon cycle)
- On success: writes `transmissionTorrentId`, `transmissionTorrentHash` back to candidate record
- UI: button disabled per-row while in flight; shows brief green "Queued" confirmation on success; inline red error on failure
- Eligible candidates: `status === 'failed'` or `status === 'skipped_no_match'`

---

## Explicit Deferrals

- Router extraction to Hono (target: when structured DB migrations are introduced)
- Bulk multi-torrent actions
- Audit log / action history
- ArchiveStrip copy update (separate, small PR)
- `StatusChip` style updates for new display states (handled during implementation if trivial)

---

## Exit Condition

A user can pause, resume, remove, and requeue torrents entirely from the Pirate Claw dashboard without opening the Transmission web UI. Missing torrents can be resolved to a terminal state. The data model has a single source of truth for torrent state. The DB carries no `lifecycle_status` column.

## Retrospective

**Delivered:** 2026-04-19. Seven tickets, six PRs (#181–186), stacked branches.

### What went well

**Data model clean break landed atomically.** Dropping `CandidateLifecycleStatus` and replacing it with `torrentDisplayState()` + `pirateClawDisposition` was the right call. The derived-state approach eliminated a whole class of reconciler drift bugs. The startup migration ran silently on existing DBs.

**Security review caught real gaps.** CodeRabbit flagged missing `checkWriteAuth` on all four torrent action endpoints (P20.05) and the `dispose` endpoint (P20.04). These were genuine auth holes, not false positives. The review cycle paid for itself.

**Stacked branch discipline held.** Seven tickets, each branching off the previous, with no merge conflicts across the full chain. The orchestrator start/review flow kept handoffs clean.

### What was harder than expected

**CI stacking friction.** Each ticket inherits the pre-existing web test failures from the base branch. The root cause (Svelte component test breakage from P19) was not in scope for P20, so CI stayed red throughout the stack. This created noise in every review cycle. The web test failures should be isolated and fixed in a standalone ticket before P21.

**Queue button design required two passes.** The initial implementation didn't guard historical failed outcome rows after requeue — `listSkippedNoMatchOutcomes` returned `feed_item_outcomes` rows by status, but after a successful requeue the `candidate_state` status changed while the outcome row stayed `failed`. CodeRabbit caught this. The fix (JOIN `candidate_state` and filter by current status) required updating the SQL query and the test.

**`SkippedOutcomeRecord` naming is now stale.** The query now returns both `skipped_no_match` and `failed` outcomes, but the function and API parameter are still called `listSkippedNoMatchOutcomes` / `?status=skipped_no_match`. This should be renamed to `listRecentFeedItemOutcomesForReview` in a future cleanup.

### Decisions that held

- **Option A (synchronous submit) for requeue** — the right call. The alternative (defer to next daemon cycle) would have left users without any confirmation of success and made the Queue button UX feel broken.
- **Not extracting the router** — still the right deferral. The API file grew again but extracting to Hono before DB migrations arrive would be premature.
- **`pirateClawDisposition` as a terminal field** — working correctly. The reconciler skip guard (`WHERE pirate_claw_disposition IS NULL`) is clean.
