# E3.03 Planning And State Core Extraction

Separate plan/state mechanics from command orchestration.

## Deliverable

- move config loading and resolution into `config/`
- move plan parsing, plan-key derivation, and plan discovery into `planning/`
- move state load/save/sync/repair and repo-state inference into `state/`

## Acceptance

- command handlers consume planning/state services instead of re-deriving repo facts inline
- state file shape and inferred-status semantics remain unchanged
- plan discovery and branch inference continue to behave as they do today

## Explicit Deferrals

- no review-lifecycle extraction in this ticket
- no PR-metadata extraction in this ticket
- no workflow-semantic changes

## Rationale

This ticket separates config loading, plan discovery and parsing, and delivery-state persistence and repo inference into dedicated modules so later tickets can rewire command handling without continuing to mix orchestration with planning and storage mechanics.

The extraction preserves the existing state shape, plan lookup behavior, and branch inference semantics by keeping the orchestrator's exported facade stable while turning it into a thin caller over the new `config/`, `planning/`, and `state/` module boundaries.
