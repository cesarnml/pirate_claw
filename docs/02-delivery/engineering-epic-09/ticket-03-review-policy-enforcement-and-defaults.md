# EE9.03 — Review Policy Enforcement And Defaults

## Goal

Make `skip_doc_only` a real behavioral policy across all three review stages,
add `'skipped'` to `ReviewOutcome`, switch stage defaults to `skip_doc_only`,
update Son-of-Anton guidance, and cover the new branches with tests.

## Current Behavior

EE8 added the `reviewPolicy` config object with three valid values:

- `required`
- `skip_doc_only`
- `disabled`

But only `disabled` changes behavior consistently today.

Current gaps:

- `selfAudit` has no `skip_doc_only` branch and cannot record that the stage
  was intentionally skipped for a doc-only ticket
- `ReviewOutcome` cannot represent "not run because policy skipped it"
- `poll-review` does not distinguish `required` from `skip_doc_only` for
  doc-only tickets
- `open-pr` gates Codex preflight only when policy is exactly `required`
- defaults still reflect the EE8 rollout posture rather than the intended
  steady-state operator posture
- Son-of-Anton guidance does not describe the auto-skip behavior under
  `skip_doc_only`

## Target Behavior

### Policy semantics

| Value           | Self-audit                       | Codex preflight                  | External review                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `required`      | always required                  | always required                  | always required                  |
| `skip_doc_only` | auto-skip doc-only; require code | auto-skip doc-only; require code | auto-skip doc-only; require code |
| `disabled`      | never required                   | never required                   | never required                   |

### `ReviewOutcome`

`ReviewOutcome` becomes:

```ts
type ReviewOutcome = 'clean' | 'patched' | 'skipped';
```

`'skipped'` is used when a review stage did not run because policy explicitly
allowed a doc-only skip. It must not be recorded as `'clean'`.

### `post-verify-self-audit`

When `reviewPolicy.selfAudit === 'skip_doc_only'` and the active ticket is
doc-only, `post-verify-self-audit`:

- detects doc-only by calling `isLocalBranchDocOnly(cwd, baseBranch, runtime)`
- records `selfAuditOutcome: 'skipped'`
- records completion time
- advances the ticket as usual
- does not require an outcome arg from the agent

The command remains an explicit state-recorder step in the workflow. The agent
still calls it; the command decides whether to auto-skip.

When policy is `required`, doc-only tickets must still provide a real outcome.

### `poll-review`

Behavior becomes:

```text
if policy === disabled -> immediate clean
if policy === skip_doc_only && ticket.docOnly === true -> immediate clean
otherwise -> wait through the real review window
```

This preserves the existing no-wait behavior for disabled review, adds the
policy-aware doc-only skip, and ensures `required` actually means required.

### `open-pr` Codex preflight gate

The gate blocks when:

- `reviewPolicy.codexPreflight === 'required'`, or
- `reviewPolicy.codexPreflight === 'skip_doc_only'`

It does not branch on `ticket.docOnly` at gate time.

Normal Son-of-Anton flow still works because `codex-preflight` runs before
`open-pr`, and doc-only tickets under `skip_doc_only` auto-advance to
`codex_preflight_complete` before the gate is reached.

### Defaults

Defaults change to:

```json
{
  "reviewPolicy": {
    "selfAudit": "skip_doc_only",
    "codexPreflight": "skip_doc_only",
    "externalReview": "skip_doc_only"
  }
}
```

This is the intended steady-state default posture: enforce review on code
tickets, auto-skip doc-only tickets, require no extra config.

### Docs and workflow guidance

Son-of-Anton guidance is updated to describe:

- explicit `post-verify-self-audit` invocation even when the command will
  auto-record `skipped`
- `codex-preflight` auto-skip behavior under `skip_doc_only`
- the fact that all three stage defaults are now `skip_doc_only`

## Change Surface

- `tools/delivery/orchestrator.ts`
- `tools/delivery/ticket-flow.ts`
- `tools/delivery/state.ts` if status/output rendering needs updates
- `tools/delivery/orchestrator.test.ts`
- `.agents/skills/son-of-anton-ethos/SKILL.md`
- any docs/examples that show review-policy defaults

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `ReviewOutcome` includes `'skipped'`
- [ ] `post-verify-self-audit` auto-records `'skipped'` for doc-only tickets
      only when `selfAudit` policy is `skip_doc_only`
- [ ] `post-verify-self-audit` still requires a real outcome for doc-only
      tickets when `selfAudit` policy is `required`
- [ ] `poll-review` records immediate clean for all tickets when policy is
      `disabled`
- [ ] `poll-review` records immediate clean for doc-only tickets when policy is
      `skip_doc_only`
- [ ] `poll-review` uses the real review window for doc-only tickets when
      policy is `required`
- [ ] `open-pr` Codex preflight gate applies for both `required` and
      `skip_doc_only`
- [ ] doc-only tickets under `skip_doc_only` still pass normal Son-of-Anton
      flow because `codex-preflight` auto-advances them before `open-pr`
- [ ] default `reviewPolicy` values are `skip_doc_only` for all three stages
- [ ] Son-of-Anton guidance matches the shipped behavior exactly

## Tests

Add or update tests for at least:

- `post-verify-self-audit` auto-skips with `'skipped'` on doc-only ticket when
  `selfAudit` policy is `skip_doc_only`
- `post-verify-self-audit` does not auto-skip the same doc-only ticket when
  `selfAudit` policy is `required`
- `poll-review` immediate-clean behavior when policy is `disabled`
- `poll-review` immediate-clean behavior when policy is `skip_doc_only` and
  `ticket.docOnly === true`
- `poll-review` real review path when policy is `required` and
  `ticket.docOnly === true`
- `open-pr` rejected from `post_verify_self_audit_complete` when
  `codexPreflight` policy is `skip_doc_only`
- defaults test updated to expect `skip_doc_only` for all three stages
- any status/output rendering that now needs to display `'skipped'`

## Rationale

EE8 introduced a policy vocabulary that was only partially real. That makes the
config misleading: `skip_doc_only` reads like behavior but behaves like dead
metadata. EE9 closes that gap and aligns the implementation with the operator
contract the config already implies.

Using `'skipped'` in `ReviewOutcome` is necessary because "doc-only and policy
said skip" is observably different from "review ran and was clean." Persisting
that distinction prevents the state file from claiming work happened when it
did not.

The delivered slice keeps the policy branching narrow: self-audit decides
whether a doc-only ticket records `skipped`, `poll-review` decides whether to
wait or auto-record `clean`, and `open-pr` only gates on stage policy plus
status. That keeps doc-only handling out of unrelated branches while making the
configured defaults behaviorally real.

## Notes

- This ticket depends on `EE9.01` because self-audit auto-skip must call
  `isLocalBranchDocOnly` before `ticket.docOnly` is available.
- Keep the `open-pr` gate simple: gate on policy and status only. Do not add a
  second doc-only branch inside `open-pr`.
- This ticket intentionally bundles policy wiring, defaults, docs, and tests as
  one semantic slice. Splitting them would increase mismatch risk.
