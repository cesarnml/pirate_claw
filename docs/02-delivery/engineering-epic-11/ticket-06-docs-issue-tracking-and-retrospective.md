# EE11.06 — Docs, Issue Tracking, And Retrospective

## Goal

Close EE11 by documenting the final architecture, updating issue tracking, and
writing the retrospective.

## Current Behavior

Delivery orchestrator docs describe the post-EE10 module split and still mention
the singleton-backed runtime config pattern as current architecture.

## Target Behavior

Docs describe the explicit context model, platform adapter factory, formatter
config flow, and command-helper shape. Issue tracking marks EE11 complete. The
retrospective records what held, what changed, and any follow-up architecture
items.

## Docs-Only Ticket

No application or tooling behavior changes in this ticket.

## Change Surface

- `docs/03-engineering/delivery-orchestrator.md`
- `docs/02-delivery/issue-tracking.md`
- `docs/02-delivery/engineering-epic-11/implementation-plan.md` if closeout
  notes need final adjustment
- `notes/public/ee11-retrospective.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `docs/03-engineering/delivery-orchestrator.md` describes the context
      object and adapter factory architecture
- [ ] `docs/02-delivery/issue-tracking.md` marks EE11 closed and captures any
      follow-up epic if needed
- [ ] `notes/public/ee11-retrospective.md` exists
- [ ] Retrospective covers: - whether the context boundary held - whether the adapter factory improved testability - whether the command split stayed tasteful - any remaining non-canonical ownership or test friction
- [ ] No code changes in this ticket
- [ ] relevant docs checks pass

## Tests

Run the repo's relevant docs verification. Run `bun run spellcheck` because docs
and Markdown changed.

## Rationale

Red first:
The active delivery-orchestrator doc still described the EE10-era singleton as
current architecture, and issue tracking still listed EE11 as planned even
though the stacked implementation had landed through EE11.05.

Why this path:
The closeout docs now update the durable workflow map rather than repeating
ticket details: delivery-orchestrator owns the final context/adapter/formatter
model, issue tracking marks the epic closed, Start Here points future delivery
tooling work at the new architecture, and the retrospective captures the lessons
for future agents.

Alternative considered:
Leaving Start Here unchanged would keep the ticket inside its narrow change
surface, but that document is the first place future delivery-tooling agents look
for current repo state. A one-line status update avoids sending them to EE11 as
future work after EE11 has closed.

Deferred:
No new follow-up epic is opened for the context boundary. Future cleanup should
be proposed from concrete friction in later delivery-tooling work, not from this
closeout ticket.
