# P11.05 Background TMDB enrichment scheduler

## Goal

Run TMDB metadata refresh on a **daemon background schedule** (not inline with RSS polling), respecting cache TTLs and negative-cache rules, backfilling or refreshing stale rows that lazy API reads may not have touched recently.

## Scope

- Scheduled pass in the daemon lifecycle: iterate eligible candidates or cache rows, refresh when stale, respect rate limits and errors.
- **No** blocking of RSS or pipeline cycles on TMDB latency; log warnings on TMDB downtime.
- Align behavior with product doc: enrichment is not inline during RSS polling.

## Out Of Scope

- Changing intake or matching pipeline semantics
- New API routes (read paths already exist from P11.02–P11.04)

## Exit Condition

With TMDB configured, metadata stays fresh within TTL without requiring every entity to be viewed in the UI; failures degrade quietly.

## Rationale

Lazy API reads ship value first; this ticket adds operational completeness after all read paths exist, matching the grill-me ordering (scheduler after candidates slice).

**Implementation notes (P11.05 delivered):**

- `runtime.tmdbRefreshIntervalMinutes` (default 360; set `0` to disable) drives a `setInterval` in `runDaemonLoop` that is **not** gated by the RSS `busy` lock.
- `runTmdbBackgroundRefresh` (`src/tmdb/background-refresh.ts`) reuses `buildMovieBreakdowns` / `buildShowBreakdowns` plus `enrichMovieBreakdowns` / `enrichShowBreakdowns` — same cache/TTL behavior as API reads, no duplicate TMDB client logic.
- TMDB refresh is only scheduled when `tmdbMovieEnrichDeps` / `tmdbShowsEnrichDeps` resolve (TMDB API key configured).

**Review follow-up (PR #98):**

- `RuntimeConfig` JSDoc for `tmdbRefreshIntervalMinutes` now matches `validateRuntime`: omitted → default interval, `0` disables; lazy reads still work without background refresh.
- TMDB enrich deps no longer require `runtime.apiPort` (HTTP API is optional); background refresh runs in daemon-only mode when TMDB is configured. `createApiFetch` remains gated on `apiPort` for API-specific paths.
- Daemon scheduling reads `tmdbRefreshIntervalMinutes` with a non-null assertion after `loadConfig` because `validateRuntime` always sets the field while `RuntimeConfig` still types it optional.
