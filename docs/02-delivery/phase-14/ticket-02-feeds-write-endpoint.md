# P14.02 Feeds Write Endpoint

## Goal

Add `PUT /api/config/feeds` to the daemon API with blocking HTTP fetch validation — the only genuinely new behavior in Phase 14's API surface.

## Scope

- Add `PUT /api/config/feeds` to [`src/api.ts`](../../../src/api.ts):
  - validates each feed entry in the request body using `validateFeed` from `src/config.ts`
  - for each URL in the incoming array that is **not** already present in the on-disk `feeds` array, performs a blocking HTTP GET:
    - server-side timeout: 10 seconds
    - HTTP 2xx response required; any other result rejects the PUT with `400 { "error": "feed URL did not return a successful response: <url>" }`
    - existing feed URLs (URL already on disk) are skipped — no re-fetch
  - if all new URLs pass, replaces the full `feeds` array atomically via `writeConfigAtomically`
  - returns the updated redacted config with a fresh ETag on success
- Enforce same auth/concurrency contract as P14.01:
  - `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; 401 if missing, 403 if wrong token or writes disabled
  - `If-Match` with current ETag; 428 if missing, 409 on stale revision
  - `403 { "error": "config writes are disabled" }` when no write token is configured
- Add API tests covering:
  - disabled mode
  - missing / wrong bearer token
  - missing `If-Match`, stale ETag
  - validation failure (malformed feed entry)
  - new URL returns non-2xx → 400 with the failing URL in the error body
  - new URL times out (10s) → 400
  - existing URL in both old and new array → not re-fetched (assert no outbound request)
  - happy path: new URL passes, config updated, fresh ETag returned
- Commit `fixtures/api/config-with-feeds.json` — a real `GET /api/config` response snapshot with the feeds array populated, for the Feeds UI ticket to anchor types against

## Implementation Note

The blocking fetch runs within the Bun HTTP request handler. Keep the implementation simple: `fetch(url, { signal: AbortSignal.timeout(10_000) })`. Do not introduce retry logic, connection pooling, or custom DNS behavior — a single attempt per new URL is the contract.

## Out Of Scope

- Any web UI changes.
- Per-feed poll interval editing.
- Advisory validation or auto-retry on transient failures (product decision: blocking reject is the contract).
- `PUT /api/config/tv/defaults` or `PUT /api/config/movies` (P14.01).

## Exit Condition

The feeds endpoint is live with blocking fetch validation, full auth/ETag contract, and green tests. Existing-URL skip behavior is verified. Fixture snapshot committed.

## Rationale

`validateFeed` was promoted from a private function to an exported one in `config.ts` so the API handler can validate individual feed entries without duplicating the validation logic. The existing array validator in `validateConfig` is called separately after the fetch validation step, so no structural change was needed there.

The blocking fetch loop runs sequentially over new URLs. Parallel fetches would be faster but sequential is simpler and the fetch count is bounded by user-supplied feed arrays (typically single-digit). The 10s timeout uses `AbortSignal.timeout` per the implementation note.

Existing-URL detection compares against the on-disk `feeds` array (not the in-memory `activeConfig`) to guard against a race where the in-memory view diverges from disk. This matches the read-from-disk pattern used by P14.01 endpoints.
