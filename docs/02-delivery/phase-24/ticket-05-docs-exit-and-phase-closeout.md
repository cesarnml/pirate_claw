# P24.05 Docs Exit and Phase Closeout

## Goal

Close Phase 24 with final operator-facing documentation, overview/status updates, and a retrospective that records the durable assumptions later phases need.

## Scope

- write `notes/public/phase-24-retrospective.md`
- update `README.md` for the final Synology supervision/restart and Plex compatibility story if delivered behavior changed operator guidance materially
- update relevant overview docs with Phase 24 delivery status and the handoff assumptions for Phase 25
- capture any durable rationale updates required by the delivered behavior/tradeoff decisions

## Out Of Scope

- new runtime behavior
- Phase 25 browser restart proof work
- Phase 26 Mac deployment work

## Exit Condition

Retrospective written. Overview and operator docs match the delivered Phase 24 behavior and explicitly leave the browser-visible restart proof work to Phase 25.

## Rationale

Phase 24 changes the deployment contract that later phases build on. That contract should be recorded explicitly so later work does not need to reconstruct it from diffs or chat.
