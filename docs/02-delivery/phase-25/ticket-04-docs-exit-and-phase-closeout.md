# P25.04 Docs Exit and Phase Closeout

## Goal

Close Phase 25 by aligning docs with the shipped browser restart-proof contract and recording the retrospective.

## Scope

### Docs

- update README, overview docs, and relevant operator guidance to reflect the delivered restart round-trip behavior
- ensure docs describe the same supported restart proof and failure boundary the product now exposes

### Closeout

- write `notes/public/phase-25-retrospective.md`
- record rationale updates for any changed tradeoffs or follow-up learnings

## Out Of Scope

- new runtime or browser restart semantics
- Mac deployment planning (`P26`)

## Exit Condition

The docs match the delivered Phase 25 behavior, and the phase closes with a retrospective that captures follow-up learning for later deployment and polish phases.

## Rationale

Phase 24 showed that stale wording spreads quickly when restart semantics change. Phase 25 should close with the browser truth reflected in the docs, not in code alone.
