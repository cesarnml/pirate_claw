# P26.04 Docs Exit and Phase Closeout

## Goal

Close Phase 26 with final overview/operator documentation, status updates, and a retrospective that records the durable Mac deployment assumptions later phases should inherit.

## Scope

- write `notes/public/phase-26-retrospective.md`
- update `README.md` for the final supported Mac always-on story if delivered behavior changed operator guidance materially
- update [`docs/00-overview/start-here.md`](../../00-overview/start-here.md) and [`docs/00-overview/roadmap.md`](../../00-overview/roadmap.md) with Phase 26 delivery status and the handoff assumptions for later phases
- capture any final rationale updates required by the delivered behavior and support-boundary decisions

## Out Of Scope

- new runtime behavior
- new Mac runbook mechanics beyond consolidating already-delivered guidance
- Phase 27 UX/UI polish or Phase 28 release/versioning work

## Exit Condition

Retrospective written. Overview and operator docs match the delivered Phase 26 Mac deployment contract, keep the Mac and Synology operational paths distinct, and leave later UX/release work to the remaining phases.

## Rationale

Phase 26 changes the supported always-on deployment boundary. That boundary should be closed out explicitly so Phase 27 and Phase 28 inherit a clear product story instead of reconstructing it from implementation diffs.
