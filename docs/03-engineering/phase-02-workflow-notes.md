# Phase 02 Workflow Notes

These are candidate workflow improvements to review before phase 02 planning. The goal is to improve signal and reduce repeat failure modes without adding process noise.

## Current Workflow Summary

- global `AGENTS.md` owns personal defaults
- repo `AGENTS.md` owns only repo-local overrides
- work is ticketed in small vertical slices
- plans are created when needed, then implementation follows
- PR and squash titles carry ticket linkage when clear; normal commits stay clean
- CI runs `verify` and `test`
- AI review comments are advisory, not authoritative
- engineering lessons are documented once instead of rediscovered per ticket

## High-Value Improvements To Consider

- Add a small pre-push gate that runs the same checks as CI: `bun run verify` and `bun run test`.
- Keep short runtime portability notes for each active stack so future tickets do not repeat known environment mistakes.
- Add a minimal PR checklist template:
  - red-first behavior
  - smallest acceptable path
  - deferred work
  - verification run
- Keep a lightweight review standard for AI-generated comments: accept high-signal findings, push back on low-signal or mis-scoped suggestions.
- Introduce durable ticket tracking outside chat so the next ticket, blocked work, review state, and deferred items are explicit.
- Evaluate an issue tracker such as Linear only if it reduces coordination overhead instead of adding workflow ceremony.
- Prefer an MCP-readable project management surface so the AI agent can read ticket context, status, and deferred work without inferring it from branches and docs.

## Desired Outcome For Ticket Tracking

If phase 02 takes on workflow tooling, the system should answer these questions with low friction:

- what is the next ticket
- what is in progress
- what is blocked
- what was deferred from the current ticket
- what is in review
- what metrics are worth tracking per ticket

The minimum useful metrics are:

- cycle time per ticket
- review iterations per ticket
- hours per merged ticket

Do not add a tracker that only mirrors the docs. The value should be durable state, explicit deferred-work capture, and better AI/operator visibility.

## Changes To Avoid For Now

- do not redesign instruction layering again before phase 02
- do not add more commit or PR policy
- do not over-automate review policy
- do not chase theoretical portability beyond environments exercised by CI and local development

## Recommendation

Ship with the current workflow. Only adopt phase 02 changes that either:

- prevent a repeated class of failures
- reduce review friction in a measurable way
- tighten local-to-CI parity
