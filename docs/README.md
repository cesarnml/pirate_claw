# Docs Index

The docs are organized by purpose so later phases can be added without flattening everything into one folder.

## Recommended Reading Order

1. `../README.md`
2. `00-overview/start-here.md`
3. `00-overview/roadmap.md`
4. the most relevant current product doc under `01-product/`
5. the matching delivery plan under `02-delivery/` when the work is phase/epic-scoped
6. `03-engineering/delivery-orchestrator.md` for delivery-tooling work
7. `03-engineering/tdd-workflow.md` for test-first implementation work

## Folder Structure

- `phase-01/implementation-plan.md`: ordered delivery plan for phase 01
- `phase-01/ticket-*.md`: one file per ticket
- `phase-01/*-rationale.md`: rationale notes for tickets and the post-phase polish pass

- `phase-11/implementation-plan.md`: TMDB metadata enrichment delivery plan (tickets P11.01–P11.06; delivered on `main`)
- `phase-12/implementation-plan.md`: dashboard design system and read-only UI redesign (tickets P12.01–P12.08)

### `03-engineering`

Cross-cutting engineering rules that apply beyond a single phase.

- `epic-01-pr-body-reporting-unification.md`: shared reviewer-facing PR body reporting cleanup for ticket-linked and standalone orchestrator flows
- `epic-02-delivery-orchestrator-pr-flow-convergence.md`: reviewer-sized convergence plan for shared post-PR external AI-review lifecycle architecture
- `epic-03-delivery-orchestrator-modularity-and-concern-separation.md`: concern-first modularization plan for the delivery orchestrator
- `epic-04-reviewer-facing-pr-body-and-thread-hygiene.md`: reviewer-facing PR metadata and thread resolution hygiene decisions
- `sqlite-schema.md`: current local SQLite tables, identities, and persistence invariants
- `son-of-anton.md`: the dev-facing doctrine for this repo's AI-assisted delivery workflow
- `tdd-workflow.md`: red-green-refactor workflow for this repo

### `04-decisions`

Architecture and tooling decisions that should remain explicit and reviewable.

- `adr-001-use-bun.md`: Bun runtime decision

## Repo Rules

- Do not implement all of a phase in one pass.
- Ship one small red-green-refactor slice at a time.
- Each ticket should be reviewable in roughly 1-3 hours of human-equivalent work.
- Use Bun as the repo runtime and default test runner unless a ticket explicitly justifies otherwise.
