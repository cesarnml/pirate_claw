# Docs Index

The docs are organized by purpose so later phases can be added without flattening everything into one folder.

## Recommended Reading Order

1. `../README.md`
2. `00-overview/start-here.md`
3. `00-overview/roadmap.md`
4. the most relevant current product doc under `01-product/`
5. the matching delivery plan under `02-delivery/` when the work is phase/epic-scoped
6. `03-engineering/delivery-orchestrator.md` for delivery-tooling work
7. `03-engineering/tdd-workflow.md` for test-first implementation work

### `04-decisions`

Architecture and tooling decisions that should remain explicit and reviewable.

- `adr-001-use-bun.md`: Bun runtime decision

## Repo Rules

- Do not implement all of a phase in one pass.
- Ship one small red-green-refactor slice at a time.
- Each ticket should be reviewable in roughly 1-3 hours of human-equivalent work.
- Use Bun as the repo runtime and default test runner unless a ticket explicitly justifies otherwise.
