# Docs Index

The docs are organized by purpose so later phases can be added without flattening everything into one folder.

## Recommended Reading Order

1. `../README.md`
2. `synology-install.md` for the DSM-first Synology owner path once Phase 27 lands, or `synology-runbook.md` for current advanced/manual NAS deployment notes
3. `00-overview/start-here.md`
4. `00-overview/roadmap.md`
5. the most relevant current product doc under `01-product/`
6. the matching delivery plan under `02-delivery/` when the work is phase/epic-scoped
7. `03-engineering/delivery-orchestrator.md` for delivery-tooling work
8. `03-engineering/tdd-workflow.md` for test-first implementation work

## Top-Level Docs

### `04-decisions`

Architecture and tooling decisions that should remain explicit and reviewable.

- `adr-001-use-bun.md`: Bun runtime decision

## Repo Rules

- Do not implement all of a phase in one pass.
- Ship one small red-green-refactor slice at a time.
- Each ticket should be reviewable in roughly 1-3 hours of human-equivalent work.
- Use Bun as the repo runtime and default test runner unless a ticket explicitly justifies otherwise.
